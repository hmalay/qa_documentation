            "text": "QA Test Planning Methodology\n\n\nPlanning\n\n\nTo begin the planning stage, QA's have to meet with developers and/or product owners and/or clients to discuss the documentation and project scope prior to implementation to begin the planning stage. Documentation comes in various forms, from paper to electronic, but no matter what kind, these product/project documents have to be analyzed. The time reading it should also be time dedicated to looking for any discrepancies and issues, meanwhile also building and spec'ing test dependancies, frameworks and cases. The product document is examined thoroughly for complexity, UI features, functionality, issues and most importantly \nrequirements\n; some aspects may need to be changed to work. Analysis as a QA is feedback for the developers.\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nFeedback to developers signals the beginning of the implementation stage. The product is placed into the warm and loving hands of development. During this stage QA's begin to build test cases for the upcoming product. These cases are built with the concepts in Test Plans parenting Test Cases/Scenarios. Each test is designed to examine the product as per the Scope Document(s). After further documentation is processed, the QA's begin building test cases again to examine the code that has been provided. The testing goes on until all elements of the product have been tested thoroughly.\n\n\nSoftware testing is the process of validating and verifying that a software program/application/product:\n\n\n\n\nMeets the requirements that guided its design and development;\n\n\nWorks as expected; and\n\n\nCan be implemented with the same characteristics in other environments\n\n\n\n\nDelivery \n Maintenance\n\n\nThis is the bulk of the QA work. Regression tests are executed during this phase, Manual or Automation. After more tests have been built to meet the needs of client based functionalities, a UAT has to be drafted and handed out to the client(s), internal and/or external.\n\n\nThis UAT (User Acceptance Test) tests all up-to-date functions of the software. During this phase it is also key to build test plans, tests that check the code in a regimented fashion. These tests also have to be executed, heeding to the Test Schedule. All test results have to be delivered, in a Test Execution Report. \nEverything has to be reproducible.\n\n\nTest Types\n\n\nDuring the planning stage, QA Testers build test cases. Test cases and test plans require a full assessment of the documentation.\n\n\nThere are many kinds of testing and they include but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack-Box\n\n\nInternal system design is not considered in this type of testing. Tests are based on requirements and functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite -Box\n\n\nThis testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application's code. Also known as Glass box Testing. Internal software and code working should be known for this type of testing. Tests are based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths, conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit\n\n\nTesting of individual software components. Typically done by the programmer and not by testers, as it requires detailed knowledge of the internal program design and code. May require developing test driver modules or test harnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental Integration\n\n\nBottom up approach for testing i.e. continuous testing of an application as new functionality is added; Application functionality and modules should be independent enough to test separately. Done by programmers or by testers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration\n\n\nTesting of integrated modules to verify functionality after integration. Modules are typically code modules, individual applications, client and server applications on a network, etc. This type of testing is especially relevant to client/server and distributed systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional\n\n\nThis type of testing ignores the internal parts and focus on the output is as per requirement or not. Black-box type testing geared to functional requirements of an application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem\n\n\nEntire system is tested as per the requirements. Black-box type testing that is based on overall requirements/specifications. Covers all combined parts of a system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-to-End\n\n\nSimilar to system testing, involves testing of a complete application environment in a situation that mimics real-world use, such as interacting with a database, using network communications, or interacting with other hardware, applications, or systems if appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanity\n\n\nTesting to determine if a new software version is performing well enough to accept it for a major testing effort. If application is crashing for initial use then system is not stable enough for further testing and build or application is assigned to fix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression\n\n\nTesting the application as a whole for the modification in any module or functionality. Difficult to cover all the system in regression testing so typically automation tools are used for these testing types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcceptance, UAT\n\n\nNormally this type of testing is done to verify if system meets the customer specified requirements. Users or customers use this testing to determine whether to accept application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad\n\n\nIt's a performance testing to check system behavior under load. Testing an application under heavy loads, such as testing of a web site under a range of loads to determine at what point the system response time degrades or fails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStress\n\n\nSystem is stressed beyond its specifications to check how and when it fails. Performed under heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity, complex database queries, continuous input to system or database load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nTerm often used interchangeably with stress and load testing. To check whether system meets performance requirements. Used different performance and load tools to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsability\n\n\nUser-friendliness check. Application flow is tested, Can new user understand the application easily, Proper help documented whenever user stuck at any point. Basically system navigation is checked in this testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTested for full, partial, or upgrade install/uninstall processes on different operating systems under different hardware, software environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery\n\n\nTesting how well a system recovers from crashes, hardware failures, or other catastrophic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nCan system be penetrated by any hacking way. Testing how well the system protects against unauthorized internal or external access. Checked if system, database is safe from external attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatibility\n\n\nTesting how well software performs in a particular hardware/software/operating system/network environment and different combinations of above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\n\n\nComparison of product strengths and weaknesses with previous versions or other similar products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n\n\nIn house virtual user environment can be created for this type of testing. Testing is done at the end of development. Still minor design changes may be made as a result of such testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta\n\n\nTesting typically done by end-users or others. Final testing before releasing application for commercial purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Plans\n\n\nEarly in the deployment planning phase, the testing team creates a test plan. The test plan defines the objectives and scope of the testing effort, and identifies the methodology that your team will use to conduct tests. It also identifies the hardware, software, and tools required for testing and the features and functions that will be tested. A well-rounded test plan notes any risk factors that jeopardize testing and includes a testing schedule.\n\n\nIf your testing team is divided into technology sub-teams, each sub-team should develop a test plan for that team's specific technology area. For example, the networking team would write a test plan for testing networking features. All members of each sub-team should review and approve its team's test plan before it is integrated into the general test plan.\n\n\nDefining Test Scope\n\n\nIn the scope and objectives section of the test plan, the testing team describes specifically what you want your testing to accomplish.\n\n\nAlso, you need to define the scope of your testing by identifying what you will test and what you will not. For example, you might limit your testing of client computer hardware to the minimum supported configurations or to the standard configurations.\n\n\nIdentify Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nList the hardware that you need to conduct tests. Include components such as video cards, modems, routers and external drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nList the software that you need to test the compatibility of your applications within defined environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironments\n\n\nInclude databases or environments that you need to prepare for testing applications. Also include a description of the resources that you need to populate the databases, such as personal and business data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nIdentify the number of testers you need and the skill level required. Include consultants and other support personnel, as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\nFor example, any additional learning or training that your testers need to complete prior to testing their assigned applications or technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nInclude all tools or scripts that you need to automate testing and to track results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList Features\n\n\nList all the features or aspects of features that need to be tested. This part of the test plan describes what to test, not how to test. For example:\n\n\n\n\nContact Form\n\n\nCheckout/Shopping Cart\n\n\nRegistration \n Log In\n\n\nAccount Management\n\n\nRMA Return Management\n\n\n\n\nDefine Acceptance Criteria\n\n\nAcceptance criteria is to be determined by the User Stories that make up the MVP. The user stories will follow but the test coverage has to ensure:\n\n\n\n\nThe functionality of each feature and service that implemented\n\n\nInteroperability with existing components and systems in the production environment, both during the phase-in period and after the environment has been rolled out\n\n\nHardware and driver compatibility for every type of client computer\n\n\nApplication compatibility for every application\n\n\nApplication compatibility for every server application\n\n\nOptimization of configurations, such as those for standardized desktops on client computers\n\n\nBaselines (a range of measurements derived from performance monitoring that represents acceptable performance under typical conditions) for performance monitoring\n\n\nBaselines and stress tests for capacity planning\n\n\nProcedures for deployment and post-deployment administration, such as procedures for upgrading a client computer and for backing out of a faulty rollout process.\n\n\nUses the required tools and utilities\n\n\nDescribes the risk factors that could prevent the successful completion of all required tests.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Test Schedule\n\n\nDraft a preliminary schedule that includes each test listed in the test plan. The schedule can help you coordinate test lab use among sub-teams. Assign a team member, ideally the test lab manager, if your team has one, to maintain and update the lab schedule. Having an up-to-date schedule is critical when unscheduled lab requests are submitted.\n\n\nTesting occurs through all phases of development. The dates below denote stress, forced-error, UAT, End to End and System testing prior to client review. Testing will continue to occur during development and integration. Automation and unit tests to be completed in parallel to manual testing, if feasible and necessary. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Name\n\n\nDuration (days)\n\n\nStart\n\n\nFinish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Name\n\n\n36\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\n22\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQA Review #1 - Theta Testing\n\n\n2\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment (Revisions)\n\n\n2\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment to QA Environment\n\n\n2\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQA Review #2 - Beta Testing\n\n\n1\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment to Stage or Alpha Environment\n\n\n2\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal QA - Alpha Testing\n\n\n5\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine Epic User Stories\n\n\nList all the features or aspects of features that need to be tested. This part of the test plan describes what to test, not how to test. The terminology and format are not limited to any type. However, user stories are business-readable and proficient.\n\n\nUser Stories \n*\n\n\nTraditional user-story template\n\n\nAs a \nrole\n,\nI want \ngoal/desire\n,\nSo that \nbenefit\n\n\n\n\nThe \"so that\" clause as optional.\n\n\nHunting the value\n\n\nIn order to \nreceive benefit\n,\nAs a \nrole\n,\nI want \ngoal/desire\n\n\n\n\nFive W's specifies:\n\n\nAs \nwho\n \nwhen\n \nwhere\n,\nI \nwhat\n,\nBecause \nwhy\n\n\n\n\nDefine Scenarios\n\n\nA test case or scenario is a detailed procedure that fully tests a feature or an aspect of a feature. Whereas the test plan describes what is to be tested, a test case describes how to perform a particular test. You need to develop a test case for each test listed in the test plan or test specification.\n\n\nTest cases should be written by someone who understands the function or technology being tested and should go through a peer review.\n\n\nTest cases include information such as the following:\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of the test\n\n\nSpecial hardware requirements, such as a modem\n\n\nSpecial software requirements, such as a tool\n\n\nSpecific setup or configuration requirements\n\n\nDescription of how to perform the test\n\n\nExpected results or success criteria for the test\n\n\nDesigning test cases can be a time-consuming phase in your testing schedule. Although you might be tempted to take shortcuts, the time you spend will pay off in the long run.\n\n\n\n\nYou can conduct tests faster when they are carefully planned. Otherwise, testers spend time debugging and rerunning tests.\n\n\nOrganizations take a variety of approaches to documenting test cases; these range from developing detailed, recipe-like steps to writing general descriptions. In detailed test cases, the steps describe exactly how to perform the test. In descriptive test cases, the tester decides at the time of the test how to perform the test and what data to use.\n\n\nSome advantages of detailed test cases are that they are reproducible and they are easier to automate. This approach is particularly important if you plan to compare the results of tests over time, such as when you are optimizing configurations. A disadvantage of detailed test cases is that they are more time-consuming to develop and maintain. On the other hand, test cases that are open to interpretation are not repeatable and can lead to debugging time that pertains more to the test itself than to what is being tested.\n\n\nIt is recommended that you find a compromise between the two extremes, one that tends toward more detail. Balance thoroughness with practicality to reach your goal of test integrity and manageability.\n\n\nAdvantages of Gherkin-based Tests\n\n\nScenarios can be written in a multitude of ways. However, when it comes to standardization, its hard to hit the nail on the head as uniquely as Gherkin does. Even if AUT uses a JavaScript or fully-Manual testing solution, business-readable scenarios go along way for\n\n\nGherkin scenarios\n\n\nOnce you've chosen a feature, it's time to write scenarios that describe each part of it. Each scenario follows a very specific pattern. Start by giving it a name.\nThe body of a scenario is made up of three different parts, let's use: \nGiven\n, \nWhen\n and \nThen\n.\n\n\nThe first is Given, which describes the initial state of the system for the scenario. This is the only place where you can describe things that the user can't do. In this case, the \"site administrator\" can't magically put 5 news entries in the database, but that's ok. To have more than one Given statement, start the next line with And.\n\n\nThe second part of each scenario is When, which describes the actual action that this user is taking. Finally, Then is used to describe what our user can see at the end of the scenario.\n\n\nThe exact language you use in your scenarios is up to you - just make sure to follow the Given, When, Then format. Each line in the scenario is called a \"step\", and should plainly describe what the user is doing and seeing.\n\n\nIf we didn't go any further, we would at least have a standard way of describing our features. Writing scenarios also makes you think through each feature in more detail. When you're finished, you've got a blueprint for exactly what you need to develop, written in language that your client can understand.\n\n\nFeature: Remote fence control API\nIn order to control fence security from anywhere\nAs an API user\nI need to be able to POST JSON instructions that turn fences on/off\n\n\nFeature: Delicious humans\nIn order to be entertained\nAs a dinosaur\nI need to be able to watch delicious humans pass by me all day\n\nFeature: Add a news entry\n    Scenario: Add a new news entry\n    Given I am on \"/admin/news\"\n    When I click \"New entry\"\n    And I fill in \"Title\" with \"Alan Grant does not endorse the park!\"\n    And I press \"Save\"\n    Then I should see \"Your article has been saved\"\n\n\n\nYou can also add test data for your scenario, which can also be referred to as examples:\n\n\nFeature: Add a news entry\n    Scenario Outline: Add a new news entry\n    Given I am on \"\nURL\n\"\n    When I click \"\nbutton\n\"\n    And I fill in \"\nform\n\" with \"\ntext\n\"\n    And I press \"Save\"\n    Then I should see \"\nexpectedResult\n\"\n\n    Examples:\n    | URL | button | form | text | expectedResult |\n    | /admin/news | New entry | Title | Alan Grant does not endorse the park! | Your article has been saved |\n\n\n\nExecution \n Results\n\n\nDepending on test coverage, manual, unit and automation reports are handled separately. An example, below work in progress, would use the @TAGS to identify a test type, a feature \n scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\nP/F\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@type1 @epic1 @scenario1\n\n\nP\n\n\nSome abstract on the feature.\n\n\nTested on iOS and Android in addition to IE and Chrome on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@type2 @epic2 @scenario2\n\n\nF\n\n\nSome abstract on the feature.\n\n\nSee more in TICKET-XXX",

Whereas the test plan describes what is to be tested, a test case describes how to perform a particular test. You need to develop a test case for each test listed in the test plan or test specification.  Test cases should be written by someone who understands the function or technology being tested and should go through a peer review.  Test cases include information such as the following:   Purpose of the test  Special hardware requirements, such as a modem  Special software requirements, such as a tool  Specific setup or configuration requirements  Description of how to perform the test  Expected results or success criteria for the test  Designing test cases can be a time-consuming phase in your testing schedule. Although you might be tempted to take shortcuts, the time you spend will pay off in the long run.   You can conduct tests faster when they are carefully planned. Otherwise, testers spend time debugging and rerunning tests.  Organizations take a variety of approaches to documenting test cases; these range from developing detailed, recipe-like steps to writing general descriptions. In detailed test cases, the steps describe exactly how to perform the test. In descriptive test cases, the tester decides at the time of the test how to perform the test and what data to use.  Some advantages of detailed test cases are that they are reproducible and they are easier to automate. This approach is particularly important if you plan to compare the results of tests over time, such as when you are optimizing configurations. A disadvantage of detailed test cases is that they are more time-consuming to develop and maintain. On the other hand, test cases that are open to interpretation are not repeatable and can lead to debugging time that pertains more to the test itself than to what is being tested.  It is recommended that you find a compromise between the two extremes, one that tends toward more detail. Balance thoroughness with practicality to reach your goal of test integrity and manageability.",

Start by giving it a name.\nThe body of a scenario is made up of three different parts, let's use:  Given ,  When  and  Then .  The first is Given, which describes the initial state of the system for the scenario. This is the only place where you can describe things that the user can't do. In this case, the \"site administrator\" can't magically put 5 news entries in the database, but that's ok. To have more than one Given statement, start the next line with And.  The second part of each scenario is When, which describes the actual action that this user is taking. Finally, Then is used to describe what our user can see at the end of the scenario.  The exact language you use in your scenarios is up to you - just make sure to follow the Given, When, Then format. Each line in the scenario is called a \"step\", and should plainly describe what the user is doing and seeing.  If we didn't go any further, we would at least have a standard way of describing our features. Writing scenarios also makes you think through each feature in more detail. When you're finished, you've got a blueprint for exactly what you need to develop, written in language that your client can understand.

Workflows will need to be carefully coordinated across channels to maximize efficiency.\n\n\nDigital Content Conversion\n: We will want to build an enhanced experience for the teacher materials that leverages existing XML content \n metadata as well as enhancements to existing print only materials.  \n\n\nApplication Development\n: Features and experiences meant to enhance the content or

for this test plan extends itself to only performance-level interaction with the application and its' endpoints and requests made under-the-hood.\n\n\n\n\nThe systems' performance during the performance \n stress tests should be greater or equal to server conditions during baseline system performance test.\n\n\nApplication should have a reasonable response time:\n\n\nUser Interface requests should resolve under 6 seconds with no delays presented to the user\n\n\nBackground requests should timeout or resolve in 30 seconds with no impacts presented to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer resource allocation should handle redirects and loadbalancing to serve performance and stress conditions\n\n\nLoad balancers should be identified and tested\n\n\nCDNs, and other content delivery systems should be identified and tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests do not meet pass criteria if:\n\n\n\n\nSystem crashes during test\n\n\nSystem becomes momentarily unresponsive\n\n\nSystem performance during tests is worse than baseline test conditions\n\n\n\n\nKnown Defects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJIRA\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks\n\n\n\n\nKnown defects are not

interaction with the application and its' endpoints and requests made under-the-hood.\n\n\n\n\nThe systems' performance during the performance \n stress tests should be greater or equal to server conditions during baseline system performance test.\n\n\nApplication should have a reasonable response time:\n\n\nUser Interface requests should resolve under 6 seconds with no delays presented to the user\n\n\nBackground requests should timeout or resolve in 30 seconds with no impacts presented to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer resource allocation should handle redirects and loadbalancing to serve performance and stress conditions\n\n\nLoad balancers should be identified and tested\n\n\nCDNs, and other content delivery systems should be identified and tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests do not meet pass criteria if:\n\n\n\n\nSystem crashes during test\n\n\nSystem becomes momentarily unresponsive\n\n\nSystem performance during tests is worse than baseline test conditions\n\n\n\n\nKnown

The new virtual machines will occupy less space in another data center using the \nNetScaler: Citrix\n solution after it has completed a POC in lower environments.\n\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\n\nCriteria for Proof of Concept\n\n\nGIVEN I am a lead\nAND I have implemented my solution in a lower environment\nAND I have tested my new system\nAND I have tested my application in the new system\nAND I have tested my internal IP access\nAND I have tested my external IP access\nTHEN I can approve my proof of concept\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for Re-Platforming\n\n\nGIVEN I am a developer\nAND I identified the DNS\nAND I identified the external IP\nAND I identified internal IP\nTHEN I can configure a Citrix scale solution\nAND I notified affected teams and stakeholders of outages or downtimes\nAND I provided a rollback strategy\nWHEN I switch the external NAT to the new IP\nTHEN my load balancer is re-platformed\nWHEN I test all my identified applications\nTHEN they should pass request load balancing tests\n\n\n\n\nStrategy\n\n\nFor all of our load balancers being re-platformed, the strategy remains the same. \n\n\n1. Set up NetScaler solution\n\n\nSet up a NetScaler Citrix load balancer, using the same configurations, rules and ports as our current load balancers. \nThe Citrix solution is shown below in teal.\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Shut down one application virtual machine\n\n\nShut down one virtual machine in the original load balancing cluster.\n\n\n\n\n3. Point the load for a single port to the Citrix load balancer\n\n\nRedirect all request for a single port on the virtual machine load balancer, to the 10.x.x.x series. This would direct all traffic made to an identified port, to our new Citrix solution, making it available for testing. During this step, we will test that our requests to the specified port are being redirected as needed.\n\n\n\n\n4. Add rule in NetScaler to redirect traffic from External NAT to the new port\n\n\nHere, we expect a short downtime. The rule in NetScaler would direct all requests to the External NAT, from within Scholastic network to the Citrix load balancer. This would allow us to test requests made directly to the External NAT to test that traffic is directed as needed.\n\n\n\n\n5. Cutover. Attach the new External NAT to DNS\n\n\nHere, we expect a short outage time while the DNS is being routed to the one load balancer. Teams affected should be aware. During this step we will test requests made from outside the Scholastic network, directly to the DNS. \nAll requests should be directed to the same Citrix load balancing instance.\n\n\n\n\n6. Final cutover\n\n\nDuring this step, we repeat steps 2 to 5 for all of our remaining load balancers within the cluster for the given application. All requests, internal or external, with or without ports, will be directed to the new Citrix load balancing solution.\n\n\n\n\nRollback\n\n\nRolling back our proposed solution is much simpler for this plan. Steps 2 to 5 require editing values to match the new parameters for certain configuration files. Given that during time of cutover, these machines will remain available and not in use, rollback requires editing the configurations to the their previous values. The downtimes and outages will remain minimal, and upon refresh, requests would return to their normal load balancing methodology.\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nCurrently we use \nHAProxy\n. This service does not provide service discovery. If there are downtimes or outages for any applications load balanced, then the requests made would fail. \nCitrix\n provides service discovery so that if there are downtimes or outages, requests would be \nautomatically\n directed to an endpoint that is up. \n\n\nIn addition, HAProxy requires heavy manual configuration. When executing requests to implement a load balancer or separate instance, Citrix allows simple configuration to complete the task. The new systems via Citrix are better isolated and manipulatable. \n\n\nLastly, our current load balancing for certain applications with higher load, i.e. GO!, we can spin and tear load balancers from the cluster with minimal work and \nno\n downtime. This means we can re-platform and migrate to the new data center, while consuming less virtual machine disk space as we wouldn't start with 6 instances for the example of GO!.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring\n\n\nAt the request of Jenhau Chen, we need to implement monitoring to better prepare for outages and downtimes. After speaking with Sanjay, it is simple to implement and we have multiple solutions available. \n\n\n\n\nSensu\n\n\nNew Relic\n\n\nNagios\n\n\n\n\nTo implement monitoring there are \n3\n requirements needed by Sanjay's team. They are:\n\n\n\n\nDistribution List\n: Who will be informed of downtimes, outages, etc.\n\n\nBudget Approval\n: This will require additional costs to implement as there is no monitoring in place for these load balancers.\n\n\nMetrics and Benchmarks\n: We need to identify, for each application being load balanced:\n\n\nWhat is the maximum memory allotted for these services/products?\n\n\nWhat is the maximum disk space allotted for these services/products?\n\n\nWhat qualifies these as downtime for for these services/products?\n\n\nMore to be defined when approved...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nThese stories will be completed as apart of the \nVelociraptor\n sprints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories\n\n\nJIRA\n\n\nStart Sprint\n\n\nEnd Sprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for NBPS\n\n\nGSM-160\n\n\n15.3 (June 14, 2017)\n\n\n15.3 (June 28, 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for NEC\n\n\nGSM-155\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for LP\n\n\nGSM-150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for GO\n\n\nGSM-165\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for GME\n\n\nGSM-185\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for EA\n\n\nGSM-145\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement NetScaler for EBSCO\n\n\nGSM-196\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks\n\n\n\n\nUnknown -- Unknown",

In addition, HAProxy requires heavy manual configuration. When executing requests to implement a load balancer or separate instance, Citrix allows simple configuration to complete the task. The new systems via Citrix are better isolated and manipulatable.   Lastly, our current load balancing for certain applications with higher load, i.e. GO!, we can spin and tear load balancers from the cluster with minimal work and  no  downtime. This means we can re-platform and migrate to the new data center, while consuming less virtual machine disk space as we wouldn't start with 6 instances for the example of GO!.",

Metrics and Benchmarks : We need to identify, for each application being load balanced:  What is the maximum memory allotted for these services/products?
